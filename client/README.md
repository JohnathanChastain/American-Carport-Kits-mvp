# Client Application

This directory contains the client-side code for the React application built with TypeScript.

## Getting Started

To get started with the client application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `client` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server with:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the application in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `components/`: Contains React components.
    - `App.tsx`: The main component of the application.
  - `index.tsx`: The entry point of the React application.
  - `types/`: Contains TypeScript types and interfaces used in the application.

## Build

To create a production build of the application, run:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate an optimized build in the `build` directory.
